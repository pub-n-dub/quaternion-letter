## quaternion-letter

A paper, in the form of a letter, to examine Ampere in Quaternion form.

### Abstract

Physics is content with understanding of concepts introduced by its earliest practitioners, especially when corresponding mathematics have demonstrated its value. One of such value is the case of action of electric currents, first detailed by Ampere in _Theorie des Phenomenes Electrodynamiques_. While this paper does not pose to challenge this work, it is instead curious as to its formalism; if additional value in both explicit and intuitive capacities can be offered by writing in Quaternion notation.
